<p>
<ul style="list-style-type: '🚀   ';">
  <li>My name is Federico and I am a passionate Research Scientist with a strong background in computational physics and
    numerical modeling. Currently working at NASA Ames Research Center, my work predominantly involves
    predicting the material properties of heatshield materials using CT microstructural data.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul style="list-style-type: '👨🏻‍💻   ';">
  <li>My past experiences range from interning at various aerospace companies like Planet Labs, Rolls-Royce, and
    Airbus, which helped me discover my passion for computer vision and deep learning.
    I am well-versed in several coding languages including Python, Java, and C++, and I am currently extending my
    knowledge of CUDA and parallel algorithms.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul style="list-style-type: '📚   ';">
  <li>Academically, I completed an online Master in Computer Science with a specialization in Computational
    Perception from the Georgia Institute of Technology in August 2023. I graduated from Imperial College
    London in June 2018 with an MEng in Aerospace Engineering. My education commenced with a Diploma di Liceo
    Scientifico from Liceo Sant'Alessandro, Bergamo (Italy).</li>
